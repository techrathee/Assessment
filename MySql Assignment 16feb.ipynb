    "Database\n",
    "A database is a structured collection of data that is stored and managed in a way that allows for efficient retrieval and manipulation of information.\n",
    "Databases are widely used in applications that need to store and manage large amounts of data, such as e-commerce websites, financial systems, \n",
    "and social networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL and NoSQL databases are two different types of database management systems that differ in how they store and retrieve data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main differences between SQL and NoSQL databases are:\n",
    "    1.Data model: SQL databases use a relational data model, while NoSQL databases use a variety of data models, such as document-based, key-value,\n",
    "    or graph-based.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    2. Schema: SQL databases require a predefined schema that specifies the structure and types of data in each table, while NoSQL databases are\n",
    "    schema-less, which means that data can be stored without a predefined schema.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    3. Scalability: NoSQL databases are designed to scale horizontally, which means that new nodes can be added to the system to handle additional load. \n",
    "    SQL databases can also scale horizontally, but it's often more complex and requires additional effort.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    4. Transactions: SQL databases support ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) transactions, which ensure that data is consistent and\n",
    "    reliable. NoSQL databases, on the other hand, often sacrifice consistency in favor of scalability and performance.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    5. Query language: SQL databases use SQL as their query language, while NoSQL databases use a variety of query languages, \n",
    "    such as MongoDB Query Language, Cassandra Query Language, or Gremlin (a graph traversal language).\n",

    "    3. ALTER\n",

    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "    1. CREATE: This statement is used to create a new database object, such as a table, view, or index. For example, the following statement creates \n",

    "\n",
    "    3. ALTER: This statement is used to modify the structure of a database object, such as adding or removing a column from a table, or changing the data type of a column. \n",

    "        ALTER TABLE Customers ADD Address VARCHAR(200);\n",
    "        \n",
    "    4. TRUNCATE: This statement is used to delete all the data from a table, while keeping the table structure intact.\n",
