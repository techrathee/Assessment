    "Non-relational\n",
    "Non-relational databases, also known as NoSQL databases, are a type of database management system that do not use the traditional tabular\n",

    "Features\n",
    "MongoDB is a popular NoSQL database management system that is designed to handle large volumes of structured and unstructured data in a highly scalable and flexible way. Here are some of the key features of MongoDB:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    1.Document Model: MongoDB uses a flexible and dynamic document model to store and retrieve data. This means that data is stored in documents, \n",
    "    which can have any number of fields and can be nested in a variety of ways. This makes MongoDB well-suited to handling semi-structured or unstructured\n",
    "    data, and allows for more flexible and efficient querying and indexing.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    2.Scalability: MongoDB is designed to scale horizontally across multiple servers or nodes, allowing it to handle large volumes of data and high levels \n",
    "    of traffic. MongoDB provides built-in support for sharding and replication, making it easier to distribute data across multiple servers and ensure high\n",
    "    availability and fault tolerance.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    3.Querying and Indexing: MongoDB provides a powerful and flexible querying and indexing system that allows for fast and efficient data retrieval.\n",
    "    MongoDB supports a wide range of query operators and can perform complex queries on large datasets with ease. MongoDB also provides flexible indexing options,\n",
    "    including secondary indexes and text indexes, to help optimize query performance.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    4.Aggregation Framework: MongoDB provides a powerful aggregation framework that allows for complex data analysis and processing. The aggregation \n",
    "    framework provides a variety of operators for grouping, filtering, and manipulating data, making it easier to perform real-time analytics and\n",
    "    machine learning on large datasets.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    5.JSON-based data format: MongoDB uses a JSON-based data format for storing and retrieving data, which makes it easy to work with for developers. \n",
    "    JSON is a widely used data format that is easy to read and write, and can be easily integrated with web applications and other tools.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    6.High Performance: MongoDB is designed for high performance and can handle large volumes of data with low latency. MongoDB's architecture \n",
    "    is optimized for high throughput and low response times, making it well-suited to applications that require real-time data processing and analysis.\n",
